**Mining Duplicate Questions in Stack Overflow**

Stack Overflow recommends that users search previous posts before asking a new  question. This is to avoid asking a question that has already been asked and that may  already have been answered. Stack Overflow also suggests links to questions whose title matches the new question. Despite these efforts, the site constantly faces duplicate questions; questions that are asked to solve the same problem. When two questions are duplicates of each other, one of them will be marked as a duplicate and go through the closing process. The other question will be marked as the master. Usually, the recent question will be closed as a duplicate of the older question because the older question typically contains the best answer.
